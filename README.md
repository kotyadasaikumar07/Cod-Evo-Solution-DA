CodEvo Solutions Data Analytics Internship
This repository contains all tasks completed during the CodEvo Solutions Data Analytics Internship. Over the course of this internship, I developed data analysis skills by working on real-world datasets, focusing on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Overview
The internship involved completing five tasks, each increasing in complexity, and covered various domains such as sentiment analysis, web scraping, public transportation, accident data analysis, and government data exploration. Each task demonstrates proficiency in data analytics and visualization techniques.

Task List:
